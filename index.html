                After spending the last decade working in a bakery as both a trade baker and manager on and off, i decided to make a change of lifestyle and became a student of Information Technology at the University of Newcastle (UON) in NSW Australia. 
                As a baker i was given the tasks of managing groups, training new apprentices, stock management, and customer service. I have been able to use these skills to my benefit during my university studies to consistantly achieve distinctions and high destinctions. 
                During my time at UON I was able to gain experience working at Diffuse Energy as part of my Work Integrated Learning.<br><br>
                
                Throughout my studies i have had the pleasure of learning programming and markup languages such Python, C#, C++, and Java HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and LaTeX, aswell as platforms such as Xamarin, ASP.Net, among others. 
                Since i was a young child i have enjoyed modifying video games and during my studies i was able to learn about video game development and the Unity engine.
